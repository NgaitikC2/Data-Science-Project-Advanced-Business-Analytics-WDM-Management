I volunteer on one of the committees in the neighborhood such that I am dependent on getting timely financial information from Kuester and answers to my questions.

What makes a Management company valuable, in my opinion, is the relationship manager. Our relationship manager, Morgan, is outstanding.

Back in September, my dog was sick because of lawn chemicals being placed in the lawn without notifying the residents. When I called to notify them that there were multiple sick dogs in the community, they did not seem to care much. The representative on the phone was very nasty and rude to me, the person with a sick dog and elevated liver enzymes. In January, we have a new lawn care company. Yesterday, the lawn care company was putting down Snapshot Pre-emergent weed killer. The granules were on my stairs. I called Kuester and their response was we just received notification about it. It should not matter if the chemicals claim to be non toxic, residents should always be made aware of anything being put down in the lawn. Tamara was very rude at first with me until I explained to her that she was not going to talk to me any kind of way. Tamara went on to say that she has told the lawn care company to give them a week's notice. I feel as though Kuester should be doing a better job of managing the lawn care company especially when we have had sick dogs from chemicals in the past. After speaking with a neighbor, she told me that two weeks ago the lawn care company was spraying something. She called Kuester and received the same information. They have asked the lawn care company to give them notice a week in advance. So what is going to happen the next time? Moving forward, how is the problem going to be resolved or addressed? Will it take more sick dogs to make a point? The job of the management company should be to manage the property! I shouldn't have to do their job by calling the lawn care company and filing a complaint to make them aware of the situation.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggf83yV6UuSC9Ls6XIej5GWBnULmYfCIZoc8BST,"Hello Sade,
What happened in your community is a very unfortunate circumstance and Kuester Management has been looking at what can be done to prevent this in the future. After being notified of the incident, your Board of Directors and Kuester have endeavored to change landscape providers and notification procedures for lawn applications.
With the new landscaper, another unfortunate incident happened where a new hire wanted to be proactive and get a jump start on applying the granules to lawns. The new landscaper has been made aware of the history of this community and why we need the proper notifications. The landscaper will be working to make sure that all concerns of lawn application are properly addressed and that notifications are communicated to the community.
Please do not hesitate to contact us with further concerns and we will be more than happy to help.

However, we have just learned that we will still not have a pool in summer of 2021. The HOA fees are extremely high ($171 per month), but we have zero amenities besides our lawn care. In addition, despite having delayed construction on our amenities center, we have not been consulted on the needs of the community.

They lack in communication and action, attempt to ticket you for small issues so they can collect money, and yet do little to improve our community with the HOA dues we provide.

Workers were recently sent to essentially shut down our street and repair sidewalks without any notice from Kuester. They started drilling at 7:30 in the morning and some of us couldn’t even get out of the neighborhood for the entire day. The company left construction cones by the paved areas that are still on our street today, three weeks after completion.

There is also an area that they are supposed to maintain as a pond in our neighborhood. It’s become the eye sore of the community and they haven’t done anything to make improvements. It looks more like a swamp in Florida. We have a ton of mosquitoes and gnats in our neighborhood because of this. No ones mows the grass around the area either.

This is a community of 18 homes. We are each paying $1,300 a year in dues (with no amenities) to have our community look so poorly. We deserve better.

My wife and I don’t usually post negative public reviews. We typically try to contact the person or company privately and resolve it, but they don’t respond to tickets or complaints from their website.

It’s been almost three years since the last house has sold! Our front entrance is not kept up to standard and our street still hasn’t been paved. On the plus side, there are potholes big enough for my kids to jump in and play if it rains. We’ve been asking for positive changes as a community and have continuously gotten the run-around.

If you are a homeowner, steer clear of this company at all costs.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggk-m8l6TsR397_AGEJyNRcG_Pyvb8smrYAqaLk-Q,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s100393783434276461973!2s0x0:0x3c5825c1305a933b?hl=en-US,1,1594135564,07/07/2020 15:26:04,4

Thanks to those I've dealt with personally,  Rose,  Michael,  Tresa.
One last thing,  I'm not sure who the office manager is,  but from my experience, this type of positive engagement by the staff usually signals really good leadership.

I’d like to commend two Kuester employees on our management team.  First, Michelle Greene, Director of operations...Michelle is consistently responsive and helpful on inquiries and resolving issues we’ve had with our BMPs and landscaping.   Her job is very challenging, as she needs to enforce often unpopular Architectural guideline decisions.  She tackles problems with enthusiasm and a positive attitude.   She is a true asset to the team!
Second, I’d like to commend Oscar Esperanza, our Events Captain.   I run over a dozen large events a year.  Each one makes use of all of our ballrooms and first floor activity rooms, requiring specific table, chair, stage and sound configurations and requirements.  Oscar works to understand requirements and  timing, and ensures the details are attended to so we can concentrate on the food, entertainment and other logistics. He does this with a very limited staff and very tight timeframes.

Freda Halls, Office & Web Administrator, has helped me streamline a weekly service report that goes to all Carolina Preserve residents updating them on the week of yard service. Freda has formatted the report to simplify the uploading and distribution of the report into Carolina Preserve’s web portal. This task was a lot more time consuming and Freda has helped improve this process. I also lean very heavily on her to assist getting me resident contact information to address work-orders. Freda is an excellent asset to Kuester staff.

Michelle Greene, Director of Operations, is extremely instrumental in allowing me to be as effective as possible. We work with each other daily on resident work-orders and any major issues Carolina Preserve’s residents may have with our daily services of yard-work. Michelle understands our contract and speaks to residents that may not fully understand what services are performed under the contract. This is huge, this property has over 1,300+ homes to service plus common area covering services for yard-work and as well as irrigation services. We meet daily and perform frequent drive –arounds to ensure services are up to standard. Michelle also updates the General Manager of major issues and I meet with the GM regularly as well. Having these professional relationships are huge for me & our crew to handle this property.

He spent over an hour with me, walking me through all the reasons why the assessments needed to increase.  He even had a power point presentation to give to me!  I was blown away by his professionalism and knowledge.

This HOA is terrible and their customer service is the worst. If I didn't like my neighborhood and house so much, I would move.

We are a new neighborhood but they are not a new HOA company so you would think they would know how to get things running smoothly. There is horrible communication and no loyalty to their customers. My husband and I bought another home in the same neighborhood and asked for our initial HOA fee of $400 to be waived since we are already paid and the new owners will have to pay as well and they refused. I asked to see the governing documents and for them to point out exactly where it said it cannot be waived and Nancy just stopped responding to me!

There have also been fire ant problems in the common areas that they refuse to address or send a one liner back stating ""We don't exterminate."" Then what do we pay for? Landscaping that is done half-a**ed once a week with landscapers that steal packages and plants off patios? $142 a month down the drain.

I'm sorry for your frustrations with the pool. Kuester Management Group does not employ lifeguards nor do we manage the pool facility but we would be happy to speak with Pool Management Company about your concerns.

Some of your concerns are based on rules that are intended to provide safety. There was a large thunderstorm that hit the area at 5:45pm. In addition, the lifeguards ask children to exit the pool every 45 minutes to give them  (and sometimes their parents) a break, rest or opportunity to use the restroom.

Lastly, we searched our records and could not locate your name.

Homeowners are left in the dark in how our Riviera II Board and Kuester are running our HOA as minutes are not distributed or posted. Since April 2015 to date, only seven months of minutes have been posted to our community website out of 23 months!  And, our Kuester community website still doesn't show correct board members that were elected almost four months ago!  I would expect better service from a management group which homeowners' dues pay for.  After our Board and Kuester terminated our landscaper with no notice to homeowners, Kuester signed a contract with a so-called landscaper who left all homeowners angry throughout 2016 as our grounds were repeatedly either ignored, ill-kept or damaged -- and Kuester and our Board ignored complaints until homeowners started to band together and our former landscaper was rehired. Now we have to deal with the aftermath expense in repair of grounds.   I would expect a management company to immediately recommend the dismissal of ANY contractor who so clearly violated his contract -- esp. since the horrible landscaping was so visible to all.  But instead, Kuester praised contractor, made excuses for him and allowed him to be paid while not providing the services he was being paid for. It was Kuester's representative's signature on this contract.  Kuester's website advertises ""Contractor negotiations and selection."" Beware of that! For any HOA considering a management company, please visit the Riviera II community first -- in comparison to HOAs with other management companies. Good luck also to other homeowners in getting Kuester to respond to your emails and issues -- you will be waiting a very long time.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cRNgGLZ8VN0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucleTpSoshQALd7xurWUXozfHch3TQ/c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg,Both Kuester and the Board of Directors have made numerous attempts and gone above and beyond for Ms. Werth.,1490994577,03/31/2017 21:09:37,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s116904313445401264803!2s0x0:0x3c5825c1305a933b?hl=en-US,1,1487552161,02/20/2017 00:56:01,5
