My experience with Henderson Properties has been the following:

I am a property manager and manage a townhome that Henderson is the HOA for, and originally reported a maintenance issue in FEBRUARY 2020.

The issue is on the exterior of the property, where water is getting inside the townhome and damaging the interior of the home. I have sent extensive photos, left voicemails for the community representative, sent dozens of emails. and have yet to receive a response with any substance. The property damage is getting worse and worse, and Henderson keeps neglecting overdue exterior maintenance.

Every time I have reached out to Henderson staff Via email or phone call for an update, I received one of two responses: ""We are waiting on board approval"", or ""We are currently out of the office"". Seems like they are out of the office every week. Since I have had this outstanding maintenance request, the community manager has changed 4 times!! (I guess everyone is quitting - I don't blame them).

We are now in December, and have yet to get a resolution, or any sort of game plan on what action will be taken to address these issues.

If you are thinking of purchasing a property where Henderson is the HOA. you might want to think again. They will charge you your HOA dues, while mismanaging your community, and letting your property slowly deteriorate.

Note to Henderson Staff: I really am a nice guy, a only trying to do my job as a property manager and take care of issues at my clients rental property. So, PLEASE, lets close out this issue so we can all move on with our lives.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpyO80BhG5FI62bzWKtuE8U9ovV8Cal0ME7IbU,"We understand your frustration with this situation Mr. Goncharov.  Please know that the responsibility of exterior maintenance for the community is governed by the association’s CC&R’s and will lie with either the HOA or the homeowner.  Maintenance for areas belonging to the association that exceed a certain threshold must be approved by the board of directors. The estimate for this repair does.  The estimate for this repair has previously been presented to the board for their review, along with additional pictures per their request, and we are awaiting board approval to move forward. As the management company for the association, Henderson Properties is not permitted to take additional action on this repair without the board’s approval.

Their work methods are unprofessional. Following are some examples:

When I sold my house, they charged $286 to provide a statement of HoA dues. Can you believe that?? Almost $300 to print out a statement.

After I had lived in my house for 10 years, I received a letter from them stating my mailbox was not compliant (it looks the same but there was a flower imprint missing from the door). I could either replace it for $700 or they would place a lien on my home. Really? The house was built 25 years ago - NOW it's time to do a mailbox inspection? The mailbox was the same one from when we bought the home 11 years earlier and looked perfect.

They are constantly drumming up ways to make themselves appear relevant.:

Mud from the empty lot next door had collected at the end of my driveway - got a threatening letter about that. Wasn't even my lot producing the runoff but I was threatened. And - why was this even an issue?  If I'm okay with some mud collecting at the bottom of my driveway, why should they care??

We sprayed the lawn for some type of weeds - got a threatening letter about the grass that was killed. I guess they think grass should grow itself back overnight. I have never dealt with a company like Henderson Properties.

My driveway had a crack - (you know what's coming) - I got a threatening letter. Either repair the driveway or they would fine me and put a lien against my home.

We have a very nice home. We take care of our property. From the letters from Henderson, you would think I was living in a rundown shack.

I will never live in a neighborhood that is managed by Henderson Properties again. Funny, when I talked to my closing attorney about how annoyed I was about the $286 charge for printing out a statement, she said Henderson Properties was one of the worst. Made me feel a little better - it's not just me.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgajRXinEjJ8l4fqOvEvJxmqKY4psMdxhG20XgP,"We’re sorry to hear you’ve not had a positive experience with our company.

Violation courtesy letters are on behalf of the HOA, and not intended to be threatening, but rather an effort to uphold properties to the community standards.

I own the condominium I live in, but some of my neighbors rent to various renters. These tenants do not screen these potential renters and just let anyone live here. Unfortunately I have called the police on three separate occasions because the gentleman who lives across from me screams at his roommates, girlfriend, and others in our building, sometimes even with threats. In August, someone threw a rock through our main door and broke 6 glass panes. It took over 45 days for the repair to be fixed. Meaning our building was exposed for over 45 days to anyone who wanted to come into our normally locked building. The HOA fee is over $250 A MONTH and I genuinely do not see what this money is being used for. My HOA representative is responsive and has made an effort to help in some issues, but I have not seen any of my issues resolved, ever. For the past three weeks someone has been using the handicapped spot outside my building at their leisure, and the towing company we ""apparently"" have hired has never ""stickered"", or towed the vehicle. You get fined overnight for having something as simple as cute holiday lights on your patio, but yet it is okay for someone to use the handicapped spot at their leisure for weeks. I also took my license plate off for ONE DAY to see my vehicle, and my vehicle again was ""stickered"" that day, so it just feels like I have no support whatsoever. I have been proactive and tried calling the towing company, and have tried reaching out to the HOA, but the prefer to do things at their own pace. I have genuinely never been so disrespected and felt so uncared for by a management company. I feel very strongly that the HOA chooses what they want to fine, or write you up for, and that is unbelievable. I am a single young woman, and have another single young woman living with me, and we both not only don't feel appreciated, but we genuinely do not feel SAFE here, and know that our HOA only cares about our money, not about those who are paying. I DO NOT recommend living here, or at ANY property owned by Henderson Management. I never write reviews, but I am writing this so others know how horribly Henderson Properties is being run in Charlotte, North Carolina.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg8AmGdMHzLR57hTgmNr6CthOMJFnoBwUE-Ogri6Q,"We regret to hear that you've had a negative experience but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around.

They manage the Crismark community in Indian Trail and do an absolutely terrible job. For the past two years I have been complaining and documenting the neglect of a common area beside my house. Their neglect recently resulted in a flood which washed away part of my lawn and exposed underground wires. I tried to contact them for two days but was only told that ""no one was available, they are all in meetings"". They took no interest in a possible clear health and safety issue on the property which resulted in me having to call the power company to determine the risk factor, thank God no one was hurt. They chronically mismanage the groundskeeping company which leaves the community looking terrible. They have no quality management plan and utterly fail to maintain the property to any acceptable standard. The owners profess leadership on their social media platforms while obviously providing no leadership or accountability to their property managers. Leadership is evident in customer satisfaction, positive reviews and quality work. Leadership is not a fancy words and catch phrases that tweet or put on  your youtube channel. If you are looking for a property management organization I suggest you totally avoid Henderson.

There are always hidden fees somewhere. They would say they were coming for inspection, then not show up. Then show up on a random day surprising us. They claimed we changed the locks and tried to charge us. In reality, the key would just be getting jammed...which we asked for them to fix for years and they refused.

Marquita, at the office, was professional and tried to be helpful. She was responsive. But Henderson Properties was just trying to cheat people out of their money.

Such matters we at Henderson Properties take very seriously, as failure to address them would be a gross disservice to both tenant and homeowner. To maintain transparency, our investors are informed of all maintenance requests and are provided invoices detailing the work completed via our convenient online Owners’ Portal.

I have watched in horror as my entire subdivision became overwhelmed with weeds and grass so high in my backyard that it reached to my knees and I am 5’9. I had to cut my own grass one day because I had enough. I left several messages but none of my calls were returned.

Two months later, no return call from any HPI representatives 😕😟😔but in all honesty, the lawn care and maintenance has improved over the last 2 months because several of my neighbors started to complain and call HPI as well. I really can’t comprehend why my board hired this property management company and they are not properly managing our subdivision. My guess by reading other certain reviews below sounds like this is the norm.

The bottom line, pay your HOA dues, we will address problems, concerns and issues at our discretion....that is if we have the time.

On the few times in the past few years that I have called HPI, it seems like a huge “run a round”, and a constant rotation of which “property manager” or “assistant property manager” should address concerns. It’s such a hassle even attempting to contact whoever the 🙁😟😔😫”community manager” may be for that particular moment.

In my observation, I normally receive the following over the last few years which is why I finally decided to write this 1-star review: ZERO follow-ups or return calls, “I am busy” what do you want demeanor from certain HPI reps, “leave a voicemail we will get back to you (but they never return your call or address issues)”......or the most exhausting: “We are really really busy”.....”Your call or anyone else calling from your community concerning anything pertaining to your property has little to zero relevance” BUT “PLEASE make sure you pay your HOA fees on time and make certain you comply with the protective covenants established for your community”.

I definitely DO NOT recommend Henderson Properties Inc. It’s a “walking nightmare”.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhOZgw-4YgKk1LAEqVhUWiHLIFv58VIvkQw6lnYZw,We're sorry to hear we've not met your expectations Trisha.

I worked with Henderson for a year. They are great to get your business but then leave you in the abyss on the management side. 4 areas of warning: 1) Service team took 2 months to replace a washer/dryer unit which is unacceptable. 2) Unreliable accounting systems. I uncovered many mistake and it took us months to fix them to finally get the balances right. Double check everything! 3) Slow response time, lack of communications between teams internally leading to confusions between the person that deals with the tenants and the person that deals with the landlord. 4) Terrible client management skills. When you mess up, you work to make it right. That's not something Henderson does. As a matter of fact, management is likelier to step in to collect fees on an empty unit rather than to help when real issues arise with tenants to try and make things better and keep business long term. There are many options in the Charlotte market, all priced the same. Do you homework and find a good management company instead.

It's when problems come up - a leaky roof, frozen pipes, sink holes or difficult neighbors - that great property managers step up and shine.

To respond to the response from Henderson Properties, here is the email we got asking for $$ to pay shutters and doors at out community in Prosperity Ridge.  If you can't find my name it might be that you don't have good recollection of your clients. Read email below:

""Good Afternoon Prosperity Ridge Owners,
Starting Monday, June 10th we will be starting the pressure washing of the townhomes in preparation of the painting of the shutters and doors.  If you haven't submitted your payment to have your door painted and you are still wanting to get on the list for this to be completed the cost is $40 per door and is to be paid by check and mailed to Prosperity Ridge HOA, 452 South Main Street, Suite J, Davidson, NC  28036.

If you are in a KB, Pulte or Ryan home you can also still get in on this as well.  The cost for painting of the shutters is $15 each, the door is $40 each and pressure washing is $280 for your entire home.  If you are wanting to take advantage of this please submit payment (by check only) to Prosperity Ridge HOA, 452 South Main Street, Suite J, Davidson, NC  28036.

We would like to have all money collected by Friday, June 7th for each section so that we can have an up to date list sent to the painters.

Thank you,

Tamra Goodman,

Agent for the Board of Directors for Prosperity Ridge HOA""",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjjxtBemRrjowwVoleCT_6Z6NTOE3r3ADaRgBTNgg,Hello Martha. I am sorry for this as it would make one frustrated! We want to say to you that in over 20 years of being in business we have never asked for payment up front for a job that has not been completed. We do not do business that way. In doing some investigating we actually do not have your name listed in our date base or phone log records for a maintenance request of any kind. Please check your records and let us know if maybe the confusion is that someone else called on your behalf or by chance you have reached the wrong company.

The first year was pretty cool. I was fine with the condo I was renting enough to renew for another year while I got settled into my new job. The last 6 months is when things started to go downhill. My condo was old so maintenance issues arose practically one right after the other. They needed the property owner’s approval to fix anything, but failed to COMMUNICATE where they were in the process.

Some issues were never resolved like major  water damage from leaks to the point where the entire ceiling  in the storage closet collapsed. Serious mold growth and a sudden infestation of roaches eventually drove us out. Henderson did nothing to resolve the issue and I was getting phone calls from insurance adjusters asking me to resolve issues on a property that I did not own. It turned into a very frustrating experience.

I’m not totally advising against renting from Henderson, but manage your expectations. I would avoid any of the properties in the Watermark complex all together. Great location but they’re all all a wretch.

They expect tenants to completely dispose the home beyond general cleanliness for the next round of folks living there — rather than doing it themselves like any other property manager. Or likely they require far beyond what is necessary so that they won’t have to fully refund security deposits.

Also, I’m thinking that their office staff is probably overworked and underpaid. They all seem drained.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhAO6S6CL6p-QZBki_Kb8ASx_fY-fTwAnafeYWL,"Thank you for letting us know about your experience. This was an unfortunate situation where our rental team did not have much control over the repair process due to the community association responsibility. We agree that the communication could have been better, and we have emphasized this more with our teams to keep tenants more informed, even when the repair process is still being worked out. Our goal is to communicate timely and accurate information to clients, and this is why the property manager personally reached out to explain the situation in more detail.

So far, so good. I've been communicating with Henderson for a little over two weeks now. I have signed a lease to rent an apartment through them and the process has been pleasant. Marquita and Nitoesha are friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and prompt.
They did not give me a hard time about changing my move-in date, even though I know it was inconvenient. Then, today I had a few questions at the lease signing and N said she would find out the answers she did not know and get back to me, and did so within 10 hours which I really appreciated. I hope the rest of my relationship with this company goes as well. Thanks for the great experience so far!

Minor Cons worth mentioning:
-The location of their office is a little seedy.
-I had issues with the company they contract out their application screening process to (Resident Research) and would recommend they switch to someone else.
-A few times when I tried to call during business hours I was on hold for 3+ minutes and was eventually disconnected..?
-Other than the girls at the front desk, pretty much every employee walked past and ignored me, even when I was waiting at the front desk to be helped.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GidQUzDina6LRKdLG7CxWRnyCxiZzTyvcThnfeK3w,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s116064146624774710434!2s0x0:0xddeda6d2b2ede570?hl=en-US,4,1457573601,03/10/2016 01:33:21,2

This review is for property managed for us by Matthew Brooks.

Henderson Properties is a rental agency that I would highly recommend and plan to use again.

They scheduled a bi-annual walkthrough of the property, I waited home all day, and found out they rescheduled it for a day when I'll be out of town. I was not informed about the change and wasted my whole day waiting. I expressed to them that I was uncomfortable with having someone in my home while I'm not there and asked them to change the date they had rescheduled it to and they said that the owner requested it and they likely won't change it to accommodate me even though all of my personal belongings are in my home. This company is beyond terrible, and I will not be using them for my next place when I move. Save yourself a lot of trouble and stress and use a different leasing company.

We just recently moved April 30th from the property with Henderson, We originally signed a lease with a totally different property 4 years ago. Somehow they merged 2 years into our lease. Well, we have now been hit with a  over $1300.00 estimate for damages which we did not create. This house was rented to us with damages 4 years ago that the original rental company knew about, and they were never going to try and charge us for those damages because they knew the owner did not intend to fix them. We had no idea that once we moved we would now be hit with these charges just because we were transferred over to Henderson Properties abruptly with little warning at all. The house was older and came with damages from previous tenants as well as broken appliances like the microwave that never worked, which is one of the charges we now have. We have asked numerous times to have that fixed over 4 years no one wanted to pay for it. Henderson even accepted a deal with the owner that maintenance request would only go through him and not Henderson which created a ton of other maintenance problems that were never resolved. I am highly disappointed and will be filing a dispute for these charges which i can already see will probably be denied as all of our proof with the previous company has probably been lost over 4 years ago. Then they send us the estimate stating we have 15 days to dispute from the date of the letter which was May 9th, and we didn't even receive the letter until May 21, now how is that giving us 15 days to dispute???? This company is the absolute worse and i hate that we ended up with them through no control of our own 2 years into our lease. Picking up and moving on short notice is not easy to do and we felt very stuck between a rock and a hard place after that abrupt merge they did that landed us with them. I intend to fight hard on these charges and the owner is not even planning to keep his contract with them he is selling the house and has already told us he was doing his own renovations. So please tell me how are we now responsible for Henderson properties estimates if they aren't even doing the repairs????  If i could give 0 stars i would. Seems like a huge Scam of a rental company and I have never had anything like this happen since the time i began renting. Charging the tenants for stuff that normal rental companies do anyway when they are fixing up the house for new tenants like light bulbs, smoke detector batteries and filter changes. These are normal miscellaneous repairs that the rental company is responsible for when they have new tenants coming in it is not the previous tenants job to prepare your house for the next tenant! charging us $480.00 to resurface counter tops that were in that condition when we took the house.  They have no idea what condition this house was in 4 years ago, they had nothing to do with our original lease! All we do as renters is pay for the damages that we created while living there that's it! And how would they even know what damages were there if they weren't even our original rental company.   Highly disappointed and will be sending in my dispute in the 2 days i have left of my 15 days!",https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-h_MzLowGoN4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuuckayfatNWG27X1Is_ksPmZ-8QRrzw/c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg,"Hi Rhonda, we regret to hear that you are displeased with your recent experience with us.

Not sure why we are paying Henderson to manage the administrative part when they can't pick up the phone to return your call.

After reading all the reviews I'm not surprised and to make things more interesting all they say on the google responses is to call them,  but you call and they make you wait or leave a message for someone or more like no one to call you.  So how do they expect you to call if you have to wait forever and if you leave a voicemail no one ever calls you back. I'm still waiting to hear back from Kellie Johnson.

The part of town we’re in… apparently not so good. On the one month anniversary of living there (the day before my roommates 24th birthday), my roommates and I were at work and in the two hour window that we were all out of the house (between 2:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon), we were unfortunately robbed.
They took three laptops, an xBox, and a brand new TV that wasn't even paid for. They broke in through my bedroom window, climbing over my bed and laundry to get into our house.

As you can imagine, this is a very unsettling thing to come home to… especially being a new tenant. Definitely NOT something that we were expecting.
Upon hearing this news I immediately called Henderson Properties to let them know that this incident had occurred. Andre jumped in head first and made sure that my window was fixed THE SAME NIGHT so that I could rest easy knowing that I was that much more secure. He told me that he would contact the property owner as well and was incredibly apologetic (even though OBVIOUSLY none of this was his fault). While I waited to hear from him again, I contacted Liberty Mutual (our renters insurance) as well as CPI Security, to acquire about getting an alarm system installed as soon as possible.

Andre contacted me again and let me know that he had heard from the landlord and that he was willing to install an alarm. I told him that I had already paid the installation fee and set up an appointment with CPI under my name, so it was a little late for that. He then contacted the landlord yet again and had him lower my rent $25.00 a month so that within just a year’s time, I would be compensated for the $300 installation fee.

What I am getting at is that Andre was super helpful, prompt in responding to my email, and super patient with me in my times of distress. I cannot thank him enough for being such a phenomenal help to me and my roommates. He has really helped us to rebuild the quality of life that was taken from us when our house got broken into.

This includes monitoring the community for compliance to the governing documents, maintaining community assets, addressing owner inquiries, and collecting assessments. When a resident is found to be not in full compliance with the government documents, a courtesy letter is mailed. The courtesy letter includes a date to correct the violation by. The homeowner can contact the management company to state it has been corrected or that it is no longer occurring. The manager will then verify it’s cured when in the community next. Community guidelines are designed to maintain the appeal of the community, which in turn keeps property values up for residents.

They have been unresponsive every time I've tried to communicate them to ask a question. They send out ridiculous rules and violation notices, trying to collect fees from everyone for the most ignorant things. In fact, I just received a notice in the mail today which prompted me to write this review. I am in violation because a rubber tile was placed beside the cement patio to provide a hard surface to sit the trash can. Not only is this absurd, but the rubber tile has been there for MANY years and all of a sudden I am getting a notice??? In addition they continue to raise our dues every year even in this rough economy and I am not seeing any incremental services. They make a big deal about submitting requests before doing anything -- my neighbors sent four or five requests to them for something that they never responded to. Everyone I've talked to in the neighborhood is frustrated with them, and they do a poor job at managing our community.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-421ytJkM03U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucnu0y91pgljQlA1eKZSwLH7COi3oQ/c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s109360256694162907846!2s0x0:0xddeda6d2b2ede570?hl=en-US,2,1364164551,03/24/2013 22:35:51,3
