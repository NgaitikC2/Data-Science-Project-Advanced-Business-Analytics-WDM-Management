Lorna D.,"Fort Mill, SC",7/17/2018,"Had to leave one star to post review. I'd rather give them zero stars. Slow response. Then lie to you. Tell you they did what you requested, only to find out they didn't. Good luck getting somebody to answer their phone. I suppose our HOA is happy. They selected them. Not us.",Useful 7,Funny,Cool
Jimmy M.,"Kennesaw, GA",12/5/2017,Update: this company decided not to enforce a covenant in our subdivision that would be a violation of county code if they didn't enforce it. They have no clue what they are doing and could cause a homeowner a fine or jail time from the county.,Useful 7,Funny 1,Cool
Mark G.,"Holly Springs, NC",2/11/2019,"I just moved into a neighborhood from another town where I had another management company so I have 15 years experience with past management companies. William Douglas Property Management gets very low stars from me because they earned it. I tried to register my name and location to pay my first HOA bill and their system didn't send me back any confirmation for me to login and pay with the 24 hours they say to wait. So 48 hours later I registered again to see if I did anything wrong and I still didn't get any confirmation so I tried to voice call to speak to a human and they purposely keep you from direct conversations in their call system by leaving messages and they will get back to you. Yeh, right. After a call from the office, 3 days later, I spoke to a representative that had to transfer me to support, where I was again sent to the eternal black hole of the voice mail and now the waiting continues for how long?... I don't know.  Wow, after reading the negative reviews about this company, they have earned those bad reviews because I have become one of them. So sad that I am trying to make my HOA payment ahead of the cutoff time and they are treating any member this way. I wish I could switch management companies but that is not an option so this review is a way to voice my experience for others to see. Customer service rating: **0**",Useful,Funny,Cool
Catherine R.,"Cramerton, NC",7/24/2015,"Cramerton Village has had positive experience.  Their property manager is quite responsive to our needs.  After reading some of these reviews, what some of you may not know is that Wm. Douglas acts on behalf of your elected HOA.  You most certainly have control.  They don't ""own"" properties.    
I have no affiliation with this company or their employees except to be pleased that their rep works diligently with our Board to keep our fees as low as possible.  No raise in fees since current manager appointed.",Useful 9,Funny 3,Cool
Brooke E.,"Corunna, MI",3/18/2017,"If you have the chance to purchase a house that is not associated with William Douglas, it will make your life better. I have lived in a townhome for 8 months and our gate has been broken 4 times. They do not care to fix things in a reasonable amount of time. Last time the gate was broken, it took them three weeks to fix. We are going on week number two of the gate not being fixed yet again. I contacted them via phone the first time, they failed to call me back. When they did reply to the email i sent, stating i pay to live in a gated community for safety, they never even cared to mention they were sorry that I don't feel safe when the gate isn't working.
Another problem i have with them is they increased our HOA fee to $120 a month, which is outrageous. Especially since they never fix things in a timely manner. $120 a month for a gate that doesn't work, a pool that opens later than most pools and closes well before most pools and we plant our own flowers. Where is all the money going!!! Their excuse they gave us was they increased the HOA, ""incase"" they need to replace the roofs if they are damaged in a storm.
Also, i paid with a check one time and they charged me a late fee because they didn't apply it to my account. They said i never paid it, but i proved they cashed the check, so they dismissed the late fee.
Anyway, don't use William Douglas if you can help it.",Useful 12,Funny,Cool
Jena A.,"Moore, SC",12/30/2016,"Money hungry. Every year our association fee goes up with no explanation. Our neighborhood has no pool, no clubhouse, no park, no amenities at all, yet costs keep going up. They just want money. They're extremely nit picky and everyone agrees.  I called one year for explanation of why the cost went up and the man didn't make any sense, clearly just reaching for anything to have a response. Something about taxes on vacant lots, yet we should not even be responsible for that! Now, there are far less vacant lots, yet cost still is rising.",Useful 7,Funny,Cool
Truth S.,"Charlotte, NC",9/29/2016,Horrible company doesn't take any responsibility for issues with the properties they manage. Horrible customer service especially from the president of the company himself. Shows no care or compassion for issues or concerns with consumers just concern about having good ratings with the BBB. By far the worst property management company in Charlotte. Don't trust what you see on the BBB website because they can request for complaints to be removed from their files to give the appearance that they have a good rating when in reality they don't.,Useful 8,Funny,Cool
MaGom P.,"Atlanta, GA",8/7/2015,"Our neighbors in Alpharetta, Georgia got by surprise a flyer ( as other thousands every day) in the mailbox informing the transition from the old management to the new one back in April/2015. Very generic and that's it.
In the month of June, we all got letters with "" Delinquent Fees"" for 10% of the quarter HOA $42.50
When you try to contact this company over the phone in Canton, Georgia or at Charlotte, NC to ask for the property manager assigned or any explanation. A pre recorded message answer 24/7.  It is unbelievable..!  It took me 5 days to get someone to tell me the name of our PM.  Then...when the call was transferred to the PM voice mail, very quickly I get back to the operator and asked her for the PM email.
The PM answered my email 2 days later, after my second email was sent. And at the end, the  issue went in circles and never get a solutions.
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT HOA MEETING to officially request fire this management company.",Useful 21,Funny,Cool
Elizabeth H.,"Charlotte, NC",3/8/2016,"While William Douglas Management could be better, it has improved over the past few years.  I think many of the problems I have experienced are actually due to the slow responses from the board of my HOA and that we have little money to put towards improvements and repairs.  

When it comes to my communication with the property management company I have no complaints.  They get back to me quickly and do what they can within their realm of responsibilities.  The billing process is simple and easy (online access) and I have never had any issues with incorrect bills.",Useful 3,Funny,Cool
Derek M.,"Rock Hill, SC",8/23/2016,"If you are a board member of an HOA and work with William Douglas, be prepared to do a LOT of work.  You must constantly follow up, double check every move they make and literally beg for return phone calls or emails.  Absolutely the worst management company I've ever worked with, being both a board president and a homeowner.  I have no clue how they are still in business.",Useful 16,Funny,Cool
Grecia M.,"San Francisco, CA",2/16/2017,Horrible and unprofessional client service. I have never been so upset at a company before.,Useful 6,Funny,Cool 1
Azza D.,"Denver, CO",10/21/2014,"Whatever you think of as being the sevices offered by a property management company, you will not find those things in dealing with William Douglas.  They have owned a property of mine in NC for about 4 years now and the only thing they will even communicate with me on is when they want more money.  This company and every single employee that I've dealt with over the last 4 years has zero concern with doing anything for the homeowners, even as far as answering questions.  
If you own a single family house outside of an area that has an HOA, you're probably not reading this because you would never even consider hiring this company in the first place.  
Unfortunately if you're reading this is probably because they have bought the rights to manage your HOA and they have risen your HOA fees and ignored any communication you've attempted with them (as long as you keep paying them), and YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT!!
If you have any control whatsoever over whether or not to pay this company for any kind of services.... run while you can and don't ever look back or fire them on the spot if you've already crossed that line.  Whatever reason you feel like you may have for hiring them, trust me, it is not worth it in the long run.
It's really a shame that I can't give zero or even negative stars to these people.",Useful 39,Funny,Cool
J G.,"Fayetteville, NC",2/20/2015,"As an owner of numerous rental properties, i was extremely disappointed in the lack of professionalism  i experienced in dealing with certain employees who handle the Kings Grant Condos in Fayetteville NC.  The employeee ""Ki-"" acted completely aggravated to assist in my questions through her phone gestures and her tone of voice.  Being a well known management company in the region,  i would suggest to the company a continuing education that would include how to properly handle customer concerns.  Sometimes its not what you say, but simply how you say it.",Useful 2,Funny,Cool
