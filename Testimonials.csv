"The best decision this community has made in recent years was to sign with William Douglas Management. Previously, under different management, this community was in decline, both in terms of aesthetics and financials. In just a few years under William Douglas Management, our community’s appearance has changed dramatically from one of decay to one of beauty and charm. Our financials have improved thanks to our association manager, who quickly addresses any delinquencies and keeps a close eye on our vendors to ensure we are getting the services we contract for. They use an excellent software package that keeps accurate records of financials and provides us a user- friendly website for homeowners to have easy access to association documents and records. Our association manager promptly addresses all issues as they arise and responds in a timely fashion to all of our inquiries. Under their management, our property values have gone up dramatically!!","Peggy L., Charleston SC","In just a few years under William Douglas Management, our community’s appearance has changed dramatically from one of decay to one of beauty and charm."

"This is my first time owning a condo. The situation the community was in before William Douglas Management took over was deplorable — trash dumped on a curb (this is still happening, but it is now being picked up weekly), owners in arrears for thousands of dollars, no one to talk to, etc. Now we are catching up on those who owe so that some major repairs can be made… A message to our association manager with a picture of the problem always gets a quick response. When so many different people live in a community together, there will always be those who care and those who do not… We are in a better place since William Douglas Management.","Cynthia H., Charleston SC",Now we are catching up on those who owe so that some major repairs can be made…
